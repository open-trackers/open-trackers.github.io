# Daily Calorie Tracker Tutorial

The starting point is a list of your food categories, or an empty list if
you have not created one yet.

(In Settings you have the option of populating ‘standard’ categories.)

You can add a new Category by hitting the `[+ Add Category]` button, which
creates a new Category and brings you to the Category Detail screen.

Scrolling down a bit reveals the menu.

## Category Detail

This screen is for adding a new Category, or editing an existing one.

There are several tabs. Swipe left/right to access the tabs, or use the
navigation bar at the bottom. You can also tap the center of the
bar to jump to the first or last pages.

![Category Food Groups](/assets/images/dct/category_foodgroups.jpg)
![Category Servings](/assets/images/dct/category_servings.jpg)

In ‘Food Groups’ you can limit which food group presets will be displayed
for the Category.

## Serving Detail

You define Servings for foods you eat regularly.

This screen is for adding a new Serving for a Category, or editing an
existing one.

There are several tabs. Swipe left/right to access the tabs, or use the
navigation bar at the bottom. You can also tap the center of the
bar to jump to the first or last pages.

![Serving Name](/assets/images/dct/serving_name.jpg)
![Serving Category](/assets/images/dct/serving_category.jpg)
![Serving Calories](/assets/images/dct/serving_calories.jpg)
![Serving Volume](/assets/images/dct/serving_volume.jpg)
![Serving Weight](/assets/images/dct/serving_weight.jpg)

Both volume and weight are optional for a serving. Set either or both to
0 where they aren’t needed.

## Logging Calories for a Serving

Once you have defined a Serving for a Category, it’s ready to log.

From the main screen, tap on a Category to run it (outside of the `...`
button). You will be presented with a list of Servings for the Category.

Add new servings if needed.

![Category Run Servings](/assets/images/dct/category_run_servings.jpg)

Where you don’t have a serving defined, you can tap on the title to reveal
the ‘Quick Log’ toolbar button, where you can enter a specific calorie
amount for the Category.

(For the iPhone, tap the bolt icon in the toolbar.)

You can long-press on a Serving in the list for immediate consumption of
the last serving size.

For fine-tuning, you can normal tap on a serving to display a screen
allowing you to adjust the size of the serving.

![Serving Run](/assets/images/dct/serving_run.jpg)

Handy buttons exist to quickly size the Serving: halve (50), double (2),
or reset (1) to the original size.

Tap ‘Consume’ to log the calories.

## Title Calorie Count

On the main screen (with the list of categories) you can see the current
count of calories for the day. You can tap this to edit the format for the
title.

target calorie count.

## History

On the watch, you can review the history for the current day via the
“Today” button from the main screen.

![today](/assets/images/dct/today.jpg)

On the iPhone/iPad, you can review the full history from the “History”
tab.

You can swipe left to remove entries. The totals should adjust
automatically.

Note that watch users should periodically run the iPhone/iPad app on
a network connection to transfer the history and store for the long term.
(The watch will store data locally for up to one year.)
