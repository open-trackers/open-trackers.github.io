# Daily Calorie Tracker Tutorial

The starting point is a list of your food categories. 

If you opted into the ‘standard’ categories, this is populated for you.
(See Settings to populate if you initially didn’t opt in.)

You can add a new Category by hitting the `[Add Category]` button, which
creates a new Category and brings you to the Category Detail screen.

## Category Detail

This screen is for adding a new Category, or editing an existing one.

On the watch, there are three (3) tabs. Swipe left/right to access the
tabs.

![Category Detail 2](/assets/images/category-detail-2.jpg)
![Category Detail 3](/assets/images/category-detail-3.jpg)

You can select an image and color for the Category.

You can define the Servings for the Category. More on that below.

In ‘Food Groups’ you can limit which food group presets will be displayed
for the Category.

## ‘Quick’ Logging Calories for a Category

You can log a simple calorie amount for a Category. For example, 325
calories for an ‘Entree’ Category.

Tap the Category from the main screen.

For the watch, drag down from the top to reveal the ‘Quick Log’ toolbar
button.

For the iPhone, tap the bolt icon in the toolbar.

Enter the amount. Recent amounts for the Category should be displayed
below. Tap ‘Consume’ to log the calories.

## Serving Detail

You define Servings for things you eat regularly.

This screen is for adding a new Serving, or editing an existing one.

On the watch there are two (2) tabs. Swipe left/right to access the tabs.

## Logging Calories for a Serving

Once you have defined a Serving for a Category, it’s ready to log.

From the main screen, tap on a Category to run it (outside of the `...`
button, which will bring you to the Category Detail screen).

### Logging As-is

To log the Serving as-is, you can long press.

### Fine-tuning

To fine-tune, tap the Serving row, and adjust the size of the serving if
necessary. For example, 50% is half the size of the Serving.

If you provided a weight and/or volume for the Serving, they will adjust
with the size.

Handy buttons exist to quickly size the Serving: halve (50), double (2),
or reset (1) to the original size.

You can also edit the Serving, if needed.

Tap ‘Consume’ to log the calories.

![Run Serving](/assets/images/serving-run-intensity.jpg)

That’s most of it. There’s a top-level Settings screen too, but that’s
pretty self-explanatory.

## History

On the watch, you can review the history for the current day via the
“Today” button from the main screen.

On the iPhone/iPad, you can review the full history from the “History”
tab.

You can swipe left to remove entries. The totals should adjust
automatically.

Note that watch users should periodically run the iPhone/iPad app on
a network connection to transfer the history and store for the long term.
(The watch will store data locally for up to one year.)
